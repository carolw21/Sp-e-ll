# Sp-e-ll
Practice spelling words in any language in a simple and relaxed interface. 
[Try it out!](http://spell.paperplane.io)
# How it Works
You can enter however many words you want to practice, set the number of times you want to practice each word, and press begin. Enable speech if you want an extra challenge. The word will appear, and each time you get it correct, it will fade a little, forcing you to slowly remember the word. Of course if you are incorrect, the word will become visible again to give you a bit of a reminder. 
With speech, you will only see the word initially, and afterwards, you will only have the spoken word to rely on.
In addition, we have used Firebase and Google Authentication to allow each user to view all of their previously missed words.
# What Else is in Store?
Given more time, we would like to add a feature allowing users to practice on the set of missed words. In addition, we wanted to integrate the Google Drive API, so users can important words from a document and save their missed words to a file for later review. In addition, we were tinkering with the idea of adding image association to strengthen one's memory and practice. 
We hope that Sp-e-ll will be of use to any language learner out there!
